Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) Simulation

This repository contains the project files for the Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) simulation, developed as part of the CME 3204 Data Communications and Computer Networks course at DEU for the Spring 2023-2024 semester. The project involves designing and simulating a MAN using Cisco Packet Tracer, adhering to specific network requirements and scenarios.

Contents:
Simulation Design File: The Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt/.pkz) file of the MAN simulation.
Project Report: A comprehensive report detailing the network architecture, traffic analysis, and simulation results, following the IEEE citation style.

Project Overview:
The project focuses on building a MAN that connects two distinct branch offices through an ISP, with multiple facilities in each branch having different networking requirements. Various scenarios, such as web browsing, VoIP communication, FTP transfers, and email exchanges, are simulated to evaluate the network's functionality and performance.

Key Features:
- Design of a scalable and efficient MAN with minimal delay and adequate support for network expansion.
- Simulation of multiple real-world scenarios to test network reliability and performance.
- Detailed traffic analysis and protocol data unit (PDU) inspection to validate network operations.
